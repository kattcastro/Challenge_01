# Challenge_01

User Story 
In this weeks challenge I was asked to change a starter code to make it more semantic and accessible.

Criteria 
In order to make the code semantic and accessible a chage of elements was necessary in order to give meaning to the code.
TO make it more accesible for all, description of text and images were added.
